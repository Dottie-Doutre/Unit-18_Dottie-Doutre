## Assignment Summary:

As a fintech engineer, I am tasked with building a blockchain-based ledger system for a large bank. 

This system also needs to be on a user-friendly interface to allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (transfer money between senders and recievers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

This was completed by completing the steps below outlined in the PyChain.py file.

### PyChain.py process:
```
Record data class.
Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data.
Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface.
Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.
```

### Technologies used:
- GitBash (dev)
- Python
- VS Code
- Streamlit application

## Streamlit and coding:

The code that conducts the steps in recording, storing data and validating the transactions on the blockchain ledger is within the "Starter_Code" folder.

PyChain.py is a VS Code file containing the code. To open and use it in a user-friendly interface:

1. Open your GitBash or Terminal.
2. Pip install streamlit (if not already done so).
3. Navigate to where the PyChain.py file is stored.
4. Activate your dev environment.
5. Input into GitBash or Terminal $ streamlit run pychain.py

This will then open on your local host URL.

The interface in which you can interact with the ledger utilies an application called Streamlit.

Streamlit is an application in which it runs data scripts into a shareable web app. It is an open-source and can utilise python coding to create products such as the ledger shown below.

It has many components, visualisatins and widgets which enchance the userability and presentaton of said project.
